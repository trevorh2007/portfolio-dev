# TODO

- Contact back end hook up, then decide what service to use to send email/notification to phone
- project section filled out with Discord bot app and other applications
- about section to add a link to contact page
- about section re-word elevator pitch
- add resume to be viewed in browser as well as be able to download in docx/pdf
- add footer, not sure what content to add to footer, but bottom of page is somewhat lacking
- fix it so that #{page}-section scss doesn't need to be a calc of vh - px, things like about/contact are too long
- remove section headers (or restyle them to be better looking)
- navbar links, add highlight under where you currently are on the page, example: if you click about then "about" in navbar will have highlight underneath
- navbar mobile, condense to hamburger menu maybe? adding in resume link will likely make this a must (extra credit: do hamburger menu without a library)
